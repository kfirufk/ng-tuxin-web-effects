# ng-tuxin-web-effects
took some nice animations and effects i found online and created an angular module for them

this is the first stage of the project, still deciding which effects to use (don't care if it's css3 or javascript as long as they are beautiful). so the commits you'll see for now will be more effects that I test and may add to the first working version.
